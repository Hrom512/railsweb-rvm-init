unicorn init script for Debian
==============================

Yep, here comes another unicorn init script.

It allows you to:
* start, stop, restart, and reload unicorn for multiple sites running on the same server;
* use a separate RVM environment for each specific site;
* control unicorn for a specific site without requiring root permissions (makes it easy to use init script in capistrano deploy process).
